📊 Global Sales Performance Analysis using Python
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Amazon Sales Data using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights in sales performance.

The analysis covers data cleaning, descriptive statistics, category performance, time-series trends, regional analysis, and profitability insights.

🚀 Key Objectives

Clean and prepare raw sales data for analysis.

Explore overall sales, profit, and customer demand.

Identify top-performing and underperforming products.

Analyze monthly and yearly sales trends.

Compare regional performance.

Evaluate profit margins, discounts, and revenue contribution.

Provide business insights & recommendations.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python 🐍

📂 Dataset

Amazon Sales Data (Amazon Sales data.csv)

Columns include:

Order Date, Ship Date, Item Type, Units Sold, Unit Price, Unit Cost

Total Revenue, Total Cost, Total Profit, Region, Country

📊 Analyses Performed
🔹 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed duplicates & missing values

Converted Order Date & Ship Date into datetime

Extracted Year, Month, MonthName

Created new metrics: Profit Margin %, Average Order Value (AOV)

🔹 2. Descriptive Statistics

Total Sales, Profit, and Units Sold

Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation of revenue & profit

Distribution of sales & profit

🔹 3. Category & Product Analysis

Sales by Item Type

Top-selling & least-selling products

Profit contribution by product categories

Profit margin distribution

🔹 4. Time-Based Analysis

Monthly & Yearly Sales Trends

Seasonal sales patterns (peak months)

Year-over-Year growth rate

🔹 5. Regional & Customer Analysis

Sales & profit by Region (East, West, Central, South)

Top countries contributing revenue

High-value vs low-value customers

🔹 6. Profitability Analysis

Sales vs Profit comparison (scatter plot)

Loss-making products & categories

Discounts impact on profit

Profit margin distribution

🔹 7. Advanced Insights

Correlation between Sales, Profit, Quantity, Unit Price, and Cost

Top-performing products (high sales & profit)

Underperforming products (negative profit)

Heatmap for correlations

📈 Visualizations

Bar Charts → Sales by Category, Region, Country

Line Charts → Monthly & Yearly Sales Trends

Pie Charts → Category sales contribution

Scatter Plots → Sales vs Profit

Heatmaps → Correlations

✅ Business Insights

Certain categories drive most revenue, while others bring losses.

Seasonality exists → Peak sales months show higher demand.

Some regions outperform others, highlighting growth opportunities.

Products with high discounts often result in lower profit margins.

A small number of top customers contribute majority of sales.

🖥️ How to Run

Open Google Colab.
